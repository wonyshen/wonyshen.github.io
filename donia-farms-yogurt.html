Collaborating closely with the owner, we explored various concepts and messaging strategies. Additionally, we made a concerted effort to outlne key topics to avoid, given the dairy industry's susceptibility to criticism. We delved into understanding the mission statement and conducted test shots, jotting down notes and conceptualizing videos. Concurrently, I scouted locations and engaged in conversations with employees to introduce myself and comprehend their roles. These interactions also served to establish rapport, ensuring comfort during filming sessions at the farm, while also giving me an understand of the operations to not interfere with their workflow

                        Though the research phase,  I found we had limited time to film each video. So, I implemented a user friendly dashboard that facilitated scheduling for shoot days and content review. As a whole, this created transparent communication by keeping stakeholders informed with regular updates on video planning/creation progress.                     </div>

Leading up to each shoot day, I prepared by prepping locations and printing scenes alongside their respective scripts and storyboards. This optimization streamlined our workflow, doubling or even tripling our filming rate. With time being a the largest constraint due to the talent's limited availability being a mom of three, this allowed us to be months ahead in schedule.

              <div class="text2-creating">
Shots were organized by location and I employed wardrobe reference photos taken at the onset of each day to ensure scene consistency. To simplify the editing process, scenes were categorized by video name and scene number. Throughout the shoot, I provided guidance to the talent, helping them feel more at ease in front of the camera. Despite budget constraints for set decoration, we capitalized on the natural beauty of the farm setting to build visually compelling composition in the portrait videos.
